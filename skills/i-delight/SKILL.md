Identify opportunities to add moments of joy, personality, and unexpected polish that transform functional interfaces into delightful experiences.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Read `~/.claude/skills/i-frontend-design/SKILL.md` for design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow the protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST run /i-teach-impeccable first. Additionally gather: what's appropriate for the domain (playful vs professional vs quirky vs elegant).

## Assess Delight Opportunities

Identify where delight would enhance (not distract from) the experience:

1. **Find natural delight moments**:
   - **Success states**: Completed actions (save, send, publish)
   - **Empty states**: First-time experiences, onboarding
   - **Loading states**: Waiting periods that could be entertaining
   - **Achievements**: Milestones, streaks, completions
   - **Interactions**: Hover states, clicks, drags
   - **Errors**: Softening frustrating moments
   - **Easter eggs**: Hidden discoveries for curious users

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the brand personality? (Playful? Professional? Quirky? Elegant?)
   - Who's the audience? (Tech-savvy? Creative? Corporate?)
   - What's the emotional context? (Accomplishment? Exploration? Frustration?)
   - What's appropriate? (Banking app ≠ gaming app)

3. **Define delight strategy**:
   - **Subtle sophistication**: Refined micro-interactions (luxury brands)
   - **Playful personality**: Whimsical illustrations and copy (consumer apps)
   - **Helpful surprises**: Anticipating needs before users ask (productivity tools)
   - **Sensory richness**: Satisfying sounds, smooth animations (creative tools)

If any of these are not answered by design context (`design/context.md`, `.impeccable.md`, or `design/direction.md`), STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. Use the answer to inform your delight strategy. If the answer is unclear or deferred, proceed with micro-feedback only as the safe default — no personality changes.

**CRITICAL**: Delight should enhance usability, never obscure it. If users notice the delight more than accomplishing their goal, you've gone too far.

## Delight Principles

Follow these guidelines:

### Delight Amplifies, Never Blocks
- Delight moments should be quick (< 1 second)
- Never delay core functionality for delight
- Make delight skippable or subtle
- Respect user's time and task focus

### Surprise and Discovery
- Hide delightful details for users to discover
- Reward exploration and curiosity
- Don't announce every delight moment
- Let users share discoveries with others

### Appropriate to Context
- Match delight to emotional moment (celebrate success, empathize with errors)
- Respect the user's state (don't be playful during critical errors)
- Match brand personality and audience expectations
- Cultural sensitivity (what's delightful varies by culture)

### Compound Over Time
- Delight should remain fresh with repeated use
- Vary responses (not same animation every time)
- Reveal deeper layers with continued use
- Build anticipation through patterns

## Propose Changes

After analyzing the current state, present your proposed changes to the user:

1. **Assessment**: What's wrong and why (your domain analysis above)
2. **Proposed changes**: Specific changes ranked by impact, with rationale
3. **Verification plan**: What to check after implementation (LLM self-check items + Playwright verification if available)

Then STOP and confirm before implementing:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Here's what I propose. How would you like to proceed?"
  header: "Confirm"
  options:
    - label: "Implement"
      description: "Looks good — go ahead and make these changes."
    - label: "Refine scope"
      description: "I want to adjust what's included before you start."
    - label: "Challenge this first"
      description: "I'll run /mine.challenge against your proposal before we proceed."
    - label: "Stop here"
      description: "Don't implement anything. The proposal is in this conversation only."
```

If "Implement" → proceed to implementation below.
If "Refine scope" → ask what to change, update proposal, re-confirm.
<!-- CHALLENGE-CALLER -->
If "Challenge this first" → invoke `/mine.challenge` inline against the proposal, read findings, revise proposal, re-present this gate.
If "Stop here" → end the skill.

## Delight Techniques

Add personality and joy through these methods:

### Micro-interactions & Animation

**Button delight**:
```css
/* Satisfying button press */
.button {
  transition: transform 0.1s, box-shadow 0.1s;
}
.button:active {
  transform: translateY(2px);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}

/* Ripple effect on click */
/* Smooth lift on hover */
.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  transition: transform 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1); /* ease-out-quart */
}
```

**Loading delight**:
- Playful loading animations (not just spinners)
- Personality in loading messages (write product-specific ones, not generic AI filler)
- Progress indication with encouraging messages
- Skeleton screens with subtle animations

**Success animations**:
- Checkmark draw animation
- Confetti burst for major achievements
- Gentle scale + fade for confirmation
- Satisfying sound effects (subtle)

**Hover surprises**:
- Icons that animate on hover
- Color shifts or glow effects
- Tooltip reveals with personality
- Cursor changes (custom cursors for branded experiences)

### Personality in Copy

**Note**: Playful error copy is appropriate only for non-blocking, easily recoverable errors (404s, empty search results) on playful brands. For serious errors (data loss, permission failures, blocking errors), empathy overrides personality — see /i-clarify.

**Playful error messages** (non-blocking errors only):
```
"Error 404"
"This page is playing hide and seek. (And winning)"

"Connection failed"
"Looks like the internet took a coffee break. Want to retry?"
```

**Encouraging empty states**:
```
"No projects"
"Your canvas awaits. Create something amazing."

"No messages"
"Inbox zero! You're crushing it today."
```

**Playful labels & tooltips**:
```
"Delete"
"Send to void" (for playful brand)

"Help"
"Rescue me" (tooltip)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Match copy personality to brand. Banks shouldn't be wacky, but they can be warm.

### Illustrations & Visual Personality

**Custom illustrations**:
- Empty state illustrations (not stock icons)
- Error state illustrations (friendly monsters, quirky characters)
- Loading state illustrations (animated characters)
- Success state illustrations (celebrations)

**Icon personality**:
- Custom icon set matching brand personality
- Animated icons (subtle motion on hover/click)
- Illustrative icons (more detailed than generic)
- Consistent style across all icons

**Background effects**:
- Subtle particle effects
- Gradient mesh backgrounds
- Geometric patterns
- Parallax depth
- Time-of-day themes (morning vs night)

### Satisfying Interactions

**Drag and drop delight**:
- Lift effect on drag (shadow, scale)
- Snap animation when dropped
- Satisfying placement sound
- Undo toast ("Dropped in wrong place? [Undo]")

**Toggle switches**:
- Smooth slide with spring physics (zero or near-zero overshoot — e.g., React Spring with high tension, high friction. Visible overshoot/bounce is not permitted.)
- Color transition
- Haptic feedback on mobile
- Optional sound effect

**Progress & achievements**:
- Streak counters with celebratory milestones
- Progress bars that "celebrate" at 100%
- Badge unlocks with animation
- Playful stats ("You're on fire! 5 days in a row")

**Form interactions**:
- Input fields that animate on focus
- Checkboxes with a satisfying scale pulse when checked
- Success state that celebrates valid input
- Auto-grow textareas

### Sound Design

**Subtle audio cues** (when appropriate):
- Notification sounds (distinctive but not annoying)
- Success sounds (satisfying "ding")
- Error sounds (empathetic, not harsh)
- Typing sounds for chat/messaging
- Ambient background audio (very subtle)

**IMPORTANT**:
- Respect system sound settings
- Provide mute option
- Keep volumes quiet (subtle cues, not alarms)
- Don't play on every interaction (sound fatigue is real)

### Easter Eggs & Hidden Delights

**Discovery rewards**:
- Konami code unlocks special theme
- Hidden keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for special features)
- Hover reveals on logos or illustrations
- Alt text jokes on images (for screen reader users too!)
- Console messages for developers ("Like what you see? We're hiring!")

**Seasonal touches**:
- Holiday themes (subtle, tasteful)
- Seasonal color shifts
- Weather-based variations
- Time-based changes (dark at night, light during day)

**Contextual personality**:
- Different messages based on time of day
- Responses to specific user actions
- Randomized variations (not same every time)
- Progressive reveals with continued use

### Loading & Waiting States

**Make waiting engaging**:
- Interesting loading messages that rotate
- Progress bars with personality
- Mini-games during long loads
- Fun facts or tips while waiting
- Countdown with encouraging messages

```
Loading messages — write ones specific to your product, not generic AI filler:
- "Crunching your latest numbers..."
- "Syncing with your team's changes..."
- "Preparing your dashboard..."
- "Checking for updates since yesterday..."
```

**WARNING**: Avoid cliched loading messages like "Herding pixels", "Teaching robots to dance", "Consulting the magic 8-ball", "Counting backwards from infinity". These are AI-slop copy — instantly recognizable as machine-generated. Write messages that are specific to what your product actually does.

### Celebration Moments

**Success celebrations**:
- Confetti for major milestones
- Animated checkmarks for completions
- Progress bar celebrations at 100%
- "Achievement unlocked" style notifications
- Personalized messages ("You published your 10th article!")

**Milestone recognition**:
- First-time actions get special treatment
- Streak tracking and celebration
- Progress toward goals
- Anniversary celebrations

## Implementation Patterns

**Animation libraries**:
- Framer Motion (React)
- GSAP (universal)
- Lottie (After Effects animations)
- Canvas confetti (party effects)

**Sound libraries**:
- Howler.js (audio management)
- Use-sound (React hook)

**Physics libraries**:
- React Spring (spring physics)
- Popmotion (animation primitives)

**IMPORTANT**: File size matters. Compress images, optimize animations, lazy load delight features.

**NEVER**:
- Delay core functionality for delight
- Force users through delightful moments (make skippable)
- Use delight to hide poor UX
- Overdo it (less is more)
- Ignore accessibility (animate responsibly, provide alternatives)
- Make every interaction delightful (special moments should be special)
- Sacrifice performance for delight
- Be inappropriate for context (read the room)

## Verify Delight Quality

Test that delight actually delights:

- **User reactions**: Do users smile? Share screenshots?
- **Doesn't annoy**: Still pleasant after 100th time?
- **Doesn't block**: Can users opt out or skip?
- **Performant**: No jank, no slowdown
- **Appropriate**: Matches brand and context
- **Accessible**: Works with reduced motion, screen readers

Remember: Delight is the difference between a tool and an experience. Add personality, surprise users positively, and create moments worth sharing. But always respect usability - delight should enhance, never obstruct.

## Completion

After implementation, summarize in conversation:

1. **Changes made**: List each file changed and what was done
2. **Verification**: LLM self-check results (anti-pattern scan, consistency check). Note if Playwright was available for visual verification.
3. **Suggested next step**: Any follow-up skills that would complement this work (e.g., after /i-typeset, suggest /i-polish for a final pass)
